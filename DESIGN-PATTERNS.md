# Programming Design Patterns

## There are 3 types of design patterns

- Creational patterns
- Structural patterns
- Behavioral patterns

### Creational patterns

The Creational patterns provide various object creation mechanisms which allows for increased flexibility of code and increased possibily of reusing code.

### Structural patterns

The Structural patterns provide ways to assemble objects and classes into larger structures while still keeping the structures efficient and flexible.

### Behavioral patterns

The Behavioral patterns deal with the assignment of responsibilites between objects as well as algorithms.
